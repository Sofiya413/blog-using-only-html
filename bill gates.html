           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It was very much important for Bill gates to heed the lessons of failure in comparison to celebrating the joy of<i> success</i>.
            This great entrepreneur who has established Microsoft like the biggest software company is a dropout student from <b>Harvard</b>. 
            Furthermore, he has also been known for his self-owned business figure known as <b>Traf-O-Data</b> which was one of the biggest failures in history.
             The entire investment of Bill Gates got vanished and unfortunately, even the education could also not get completed.
              But, the keen desire and the passion for the computer programming based stuff led him to establish such biggest software company with the brand name <b>‘Microsoft’</b>.        </p>
