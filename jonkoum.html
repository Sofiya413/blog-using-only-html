           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Jan Koum became a billionaire in the very building he used to pick up food stamps for himself and his mother. Today, Koum’s net worth is $9.9 billion. Why someone hasn’t turned the life story of co-founder and former CEO of WhatsApp into a movie is beyond anyone’s best guess. As a Ukrainian immigrant who escaped the U.S.S.R., he moved to the United States, met even more extreme poverty, but still managed to build a billion-dollar company within five years. 

           For entrepreneurs and business leaders, Jan Koum’s story serves as inspiration. But going beyond a source of motivation, Koum and his business partner Brian Acton also demonstrate how to grow an innovative startup company. Additionally, they are a prime example of building a business that serves others and creates a massive positive impact on the world.
