           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Jobs has been known as an iconic figure for the establishment of <b>Apple</b> like the biggest company.
             However, it is extremely shocking to know that the $2 billion company with over 4000 employees has been started with only two persons in a garage.
              It is also to be noticed that this great establisher has been dismissed and fired from the company from which he has started his career.
              Further, realizing his potential and capabilities, Steve Jobs proceeded further towards establishing this biggest company which is famously known as ‘Apple’.
